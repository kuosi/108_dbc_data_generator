### The install hook is called upon initial install only, i.e. itâ€™s not called on subsequent refreshes.
### The hook is executed before starting snap services (if it has any) and before the configure hook. The install hook is the place for one-time actions, such as an early initialisation of a resource when installed for the first time.

### Copy the initial data, certificates and configuration parameters to the directory for system data of the snap.

#cp -r $SNAP/data $SNAP_DATA
#cp -r $SNAP/certificates $SNAP_DATA
#cp -r $SNAP/options $SNAP_DATA
